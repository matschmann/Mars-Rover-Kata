Mars-Rover-Kata
===============
This is a partly solution for the Mars Rover Kata
http://craftsmanship.sv.cmu.edu/katas/mars-rover-kata

The following features were implemented. 

* Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.
* You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
* The rover receives a character array of commands.
* Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
* Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
* Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)

There is no AppRunner, it's just an API
